# Simplifying how you define Kubernetes artifacts

## Use Kedge to deploy applications with sensible defaults

### What's Kedge?

Kedge is a simple, easy and declarative way to define and deploy applications to Kubernetes by writing very concise application definitions.

Why do people love Kedge?

  - __An extension of Kubernetes definitions:__ Use pre-existing definitions such as Pod or Container within your artifact file.
  - __Shortcuts:__ Reduce your file-size and definitions by using intuitive Kedge shortcuts.
  - __Concise:__ Define just the necessary bits, Kedge will interpolate and pick the best defaults for your application to run on Kubernetes.
  - __Define all your containers in one place:__ Define your containers, services and applications in one simple file, or split them into multiple files.

### Avoid writing long artifact files, deploy an application straight to a Kubernetes cluster

```yaml
name: httpd

containers:
- image: centos/httpd

services:
- name: httpd
  type: LoadBalancer
  portMappings: 
    - 8080:80
```
