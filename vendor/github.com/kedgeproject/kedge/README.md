----

Kedge is a simple, easy and declarative way to define and deploy applications to Kubernetes by writing very concise application definitions.

Why do people love Kedge?

  - __An extension of Kubernetes definitions:__ Use pre-existing definitions such as Pod or Container within your artifact file.
  - __Shortcuts:__ Reduce your file-size and definitions by using intuitive Kedge shortcuts.
  - __Concise:__ Define just the necessary bits, Kedge will interpolate and pick the best defaults for your application to run on Kubernetes.
  - __Define all your containers in one place:__ Define your containers, services and applications in one simple file, or split them into multiple files.
